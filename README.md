**Experience:**
- **Fundmore.ai, Toronto, Canada**  
  Product Lead - Fundmore IQ (August 2022 - January 2023)  
  Conducted impactful technical product demonstrations, securing prominent institutional clients and spearheading the development of an NLP OCR-based document classification platform to streamline lending and underwriting processes. Onboarded 9 new institutional lending clients.

- **Fundmore.ai, Toronto, Canada**  
  Data Scientist (June 2021 - August 2022)  
  Developed and optimized ETL framework efficiency, enhancing data processing for client dashboards and visualizations. Data wrangling and preprocessing large corpus of unstructured client data for future predictive model creation, leading to 30% faster pipeline flows for underwriters.

**Projects:**
- **Scraping Hospital Data powered by LLMâ€™s**  
  A solution to find wait times at ER rooms around the US. This project uses web scraping via BeautifulSoup and a fine-tuned Mistral7B model to extract wait times from web pages and rank them in a Pinecone vector DB.
